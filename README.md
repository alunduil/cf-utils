Cloud Files Linux Style Utilities

Description
===========

Standard Linux file utilities for cloud files interaction.  These utilties
behave similarly to their Linux counterparts (i.e. cfls ← ls).  Also included
with these utilities is a cf-bindings library that provides C bindings for cloud
files.  For these utilities there is a façade as well that can be used but isn't
required.
